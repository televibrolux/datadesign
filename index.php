		<p>YouTube Persona</p>

			<p>With over 300 hours of videos uploaded per minute, YouTube has something for everyone.

			While YouTube bills itself as a video venue for the masses, it does not have a clear demographics.
			People of all ages use YouTube to watch their favorite videos. There is an even split between man and
			women users. YouTube is now a decade old and one would think that there is a clear demographics
			for YouTube users. It's an even split between men and women who are YouTube users. There is however
			a difference who spends more time on YouTube. The 18 to 25 year old YouTube users spend the most time
			on YouTube. A great deal of advertisers do not target audiences based on their age, instead
			advertisers target users on what videos are being viewed. Generally men spend their time viewing
			videos on subjects such as sports and video gaming, while women view videos on subjects such as beauty and makeup.</p>

			<title>Use Cases</title>

			<title>The User:</title>

			<p>The user (The one who uploads videos) can upload any video as long as it adheres to YouTube guidelines.
			The my be of high quality, HD or low quality (Non HD). The user decides in which catagory to upload
			their video too. They are endless catagories you can choose from. The user is even allowed to create their
			own catagory to upload their video too. The user and viewer (The one who only views YouTube videos) can for
			the most part, comment on the video. There are some videos that block comments but those are far between.</p>

			<title>The Viewer:</title>

			<p>The YouTube viewer can watch any video of their choosing. The viewer typically searches for videos they want to view
			by entering a name or event into the search bar. The User can also perform this task. I say typically because one can
			also select videos to watch that are trending and the videos that have gone viral. Those videos are featured on their
			opening page</p>

			<title>Relations</title>

			<p>The user is broken down into two components, the user who uploads videos and the viewer who views and comments on the videos.
			The user and the view are the sons of the User. The user uploads the video on any number of catagories the viewer wishes.The view can
			either search for a viedo, go to catagories the interest the viewer or the view can enjoy videos that are trending. The viewer has the
			option of commenting on the video expressing their feelings towards the video. A view can also like the video as well as the user.</p>
